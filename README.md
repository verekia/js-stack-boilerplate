# JavaScript Stack Boilerplate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/verekia/js-stack-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/verekia/js-stack-boilerplate)

Final boilerplate code of the [JavaScript Stack from Scratch](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch) tutorial.

## How to use this boilerplate

This boilerplate is available in **two versions**:

- `js-stack-boilerplate` (this version): Contains only free open-source tools.
- [`js-stack-boilerplate-with-services`](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-boilerplate/tree/master-with-services): Includes Heroku, Travis, and Coveralls.

Either way:

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-boilerplate/releases) for the version you want.
- Edit `package.json` with your own info.
- Run `yarn` and `yarn start`. That's it!

**Don't clone this repository**, as it includes some files that are irrelevant for you.
